# Idiomatic Rust Style

## üìñ Learning Objectives

This module will guide you to deeply understand the "idiomatic" style of Rust, learn community-recommended best practices and coding philosophy, helping you write more Rust-like, readable, and efficient code.

---

## üéØ What is Idiomatic Rust?

### 1. Rustacean Coding Philosophy

- **Memory Safety without a Garbage Collector**: Embrace the ownership and borrowing system.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Use high-level abstractions without performance penalties.
- **Explicitness**: Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.

### 2. Embracing the Ownership System

- Prefer borrowing over ownership where possible.
- Use `clone()` judiciously.
- Understand the difference between `String` and `&str`.

### 3. Zero-Cost Abstractions

- Use iterators and closures for efficient data processing.
- Leverage traits for polymorphism.

### 4. Error Handling Philosophy

- Use `Result` for recoverable errors and `panic!` for unrecoverable errors.
- Avoid using `unwrap()` and `expect()` in library code.

## üìù Coding Conventions & Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions

- `snake_case` for variables and functions.
- `PascalCase` for types.
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

### 2. Code Formatting

- Use `rustfmt` to automatically format your code.

### 3. Comments & Documentation

- Use `///` for documentation comments.
- Use `//` for regular comments.
- Write clear and concise documentation for public APIs.

### 4. Error Handling Patterns

- Use the `?` operator for error propagation.
- Define custom error types for your libraries.

### 5. Concurrency & Asynchronous Patterns

- Use channels for communication between threads.
- Use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared state.

### 6. Trait & Generics Usage

- Use traits to define shared behavior.
- Use generics to write reusable code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tools & Crates

### 1. `clippy`

A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.

### 2. `rustfmt`

A tool for formatting Rust code according to the official style guidelines.

### 3. `rustdoc`

A tool for generating documentation from your source code.

### 4. Common crates

- `serde` for serialization and deserialization.
- `tokio` for asynchronous programming.
- `clap` for command-line argument parsing.

## üìù Summary

This module introduced the concept of idiomatic Rust and provided a set of best practices and tools to help you write better Rust code. By following these guidelines, you can write code that is not only correct but also readable, maintainable, and efficient.
