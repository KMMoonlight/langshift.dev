# Introduction to Rust & Environment Setup

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what Rust can do and its intersection with JavaScript.
- Master the language migration learning method from JavaScript to Rust.
- Learn how to install and configure the Rust development environment.
- Create and run your first Rust project.

## 🤔 Why Learn Rust?

### As a JavaScript developer, you might ask:

- **I already know JavaScript, why should I learn Rust?**
- **What problems can Rust help me solve?**
- **How can learning Rust benefit my career?**

### What can Rust offer you?

1.  **Performance Boost** - Rust programs run at speeds close to C/C++, 10-100 times faster than JavaScript.
2.  **Memory Safety** - Compile-time checks prevent memory leaks and null pointer errors.
3.  **Concurrency Safety** - Compile-time guarantees for multi-threaded safety, avoiding race conditions.
4.  **Systems Programming** - Ability to write operating systems, drivers, and embedded programs.
5.  **WebAssembly** - Run high-performance code in the browser.
6.  **Career Growth** - Master a systems-level programming language and broaden your tech stack.

### The Complementary Relationship between JavaScript and Rust

| Scenario | JavaScript Strengths | Rust Strengths |
|---|---|---|
| Web Frontend | ✅ Mature Ecosystem | ✅ High-performance WebAssembly |
| Web Backend | ✅ High Development Efficiency | ✅ Performance and Security |
| Desktop Apps | ✅ Simple Cross-platform | ✅ Native Performance |
| Mobile Apps | ✅ Rapid Prototyping | ✅ Native Performance |
| Systems Prog. | ❌ Unsuitable | ✅ Key Advantage |
| Game Dev. | ✅ Limited | ✅ High Performance |

## 🧠 Learning Strategy: From JS to Rust

### Adjusting Your Mindset

When learning Rust, you need to adjust some of your thinking habits:

**JavaScript Mindset:**
- Focus on "what to do" - directly write business logic.
- Runtime checks - errors are discovered at runtime.
- Automatic memory management - no need to worry about memory allocation.

**Rust Mindset:**
- Focus on "how to do it" - need to explicitly specify types and memory management.
- Compile-time checks - errors are discovered at compile time.
- Explicit memory management - manage memory through the ownership system.

### Learning Strategy

1.  **Comparative Learning** - Every Rust concept corresponds to a JavaScript concept.
2.  **Progressive** - From simple syntax to complex concepts.
3.  **Practice-Driven** - Every concept must be verified by hand.
4.  **Project-Oriented** - Consolidate knowledge through actual projects.

## 🛠️ Installing the Rust Development Environment

### 1. Install Rust

Rust uses `rustup` as its version management tool, similar to Node.js's `nvm`:

```bash
# Install Rust (similar to nvm install node)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Or use Homebrew (macOS)
brew install rust

# Verify installation
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### 2. Configure Your IDE

VS Code is recommended. Install the following extensions:

- **rust-analyzer** - The officially recommended code analysis tool for Rust.
- **Even Better TOML** - Syntax highlighting for configuration files.
- **crates** - Dependency management.
- **Error Lens** - Enhanced error highlighting.
- **CodeLLDB** - Debugging support.

### 3. Configure Cargo

Cargo is Rust's package manager and build tool, similar to npm:

```bash
# Check Cargo version
cargo --version

# Configure a mirror source (for users in China)
# Add the following to ~/.cargo/config.toml:
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = 'ustc'

[source.ustc]
registry = "https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/crates.io-index"
```

## 🚀 Hello, Rust: Your First Project

### Create a New Project

```bash
# Create a new project (similar to npm init)
cargo new hello-rust
cd hello-rust

# Project Structure
hello-rust/
├── Cargo.toml    # Project configuration (like package.json)
└── src/
    └── main.rs   # Entry file (like index.js)
```

### Project Configuration File Comparison

<UniversalEditor title="Project Configuration File Comparison" compare={true}>
```json !! json
// package.json (JavaScript)
{
  "name": "hello-js",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Hello JavaScript project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

```toml !! toml
# Cargo.toml (Rust)
[package]
name = "hello-rust"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "Hello Rust project"

[dependencies]
# Production dependencies
serde = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }

[dev-dependencies]
# Development dependencies
criterion = "0.5"
```
</UniversalEditor>

### Your First Rust Program

<UniversalEditor title="Hello World Comparison" compare={true}>
```javascript !! js
// index.js
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");

// Variable declaration
let name = "LangShift";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

// Function definition
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Developer"));
```

```rust !! rs
// src/main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
    
    // Variable declaration (immutable)
    let name = "LangShift";
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    
    // Function definition
    fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
        format!("Hello, {}!", name)
    }
    
    println!("{}", greet("Developer"));
}
```
</UniversalEditor>

### Running the Project

```bash
# Run the project (similar to npm start)
cargo run

# Build the project (similar to npm run build)
cargo build

# Build a release version (optimized binary)
cargo build --release

# Run tests (similar to npm test)
cargo test

# Check the code (similar to npm run lint)
cargo clippy

# Format the code (similar to npm run format)
cargo fmt
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Rust Project Structure

### Standard Project Structure

```
my-rust-project/
├── Cargo.toml          # Project configuration and dependencies
├── Cargo.lock          # Dependency lock file (like package-lock.json)
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs         # Binary program entry point
│   ├── lib.rs          # Library entry point (optional)
│   ├── bin/            # Multiple binary entry points (optional)
│   │   └── another_main.rs
│   └── tests/          # Integration tests (optional)
│       └── some_test.rs
└── examples/           # Example programs (optional)
