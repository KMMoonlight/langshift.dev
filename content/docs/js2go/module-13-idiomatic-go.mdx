# Go Idioms and Performance Optimization

This module summarizes Go language idioms, performance optimization techniques, and compares them with JavaScript to help you write efficient, maintainable Go code.

## 1. Coding Standards

- Variable naming uses camelCase (lowercase first letter)
- Package names are concise and clear
- Each file contains only one package
- Comment standards, English recommended
- Use go fmt for automatic formatting

<UniversalEditor title="Naming and Formatting Comparison" compare={true}>
```javascript !! js
// JavaScript: Naming style
let user_name = 'Tom'; // underscore
```

```go !! go
// Go: Naming style
var userName = "Tom" // camelCase
```
</UniversalEditor>

## 2. Performance Optimization Techniques

- Avoid unnecessary memory allocations
- Use sync.Pool to reuse objects
- Use concurrency appropriately, avoid over-creating goroutines
- Use pprof for performance analysis
- Avoid overusing interface{} and reflection

<UniversalEditor title="Object Reuse Comparison" compare={true}>
```javascript !! js
// JavaScript: Object pools rarely used
const arr = [];
for(let i=0;i<1000;i++) arr.push({});
```

```go !! go
// Go: sync.Pool object pool
import "sync"
var pool = sync.Pool{New: func() interface{} { return make([]byte, 1024) }}
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
  b := pool.Get().([]byte)
  // Use b
  pool.Put(b)
}
```
</UniversalEditor>

## 3. Memory Management Optimization

- Go has automatic GC, but pay attention to large objects and long lifecycle
- Avoid memory leaks (close channels timely, recycle goroutines)
- Use escape analysis tools to analyze memory allocation

---

## 4. Concurrency Performance Optimization

- Reasonably divide goroutine numbers, avoid over-concurrency
- Use channels to control concurrency flow
- Use sync.WaitGroup, sync.Mutex to ensure concurrency safety

<UniversalEditor title="Concurrency Control Comparison" compare={true}>
```javascript !! js
// JavaScript: Concurrency control
Promise.all([...]) // Concurrency number not controllable
```

```go !! go
// Go: Concurrency control
import "sync"
var wg sync.WaitGroup
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  wg.Add(1)
  go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    // ...
  }()
}
wg.Wait()
```
</UniversalEditor>

## 5. Code Organization Principles

- Each package does one thing (single responsibility)
- Main package only does startup and dependency injection
- Business logic layering (handler/service/repository)
- Reasonable module splitting, avoid giant packages

---

## 6. Modern Go Development Patterns

- Use go mod/go work to manage dependencies and multi-modules
- Leverage generics to improve code reusability (Go 1.18+)
- Use embed to embed static resources
- Combine CI/CD, containerization, cloud-native best practices
